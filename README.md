# Future considerations   

## Usability summary

After the last round of testing, we decided to clean up the app some. We organized the sections of the app into tiles so that each section is easily accessed with a click of the button. We simplified the content into basic design so that our users can just see how content is displayed. What was needed to be changed is how interactive our MyKit section is. It needs to be changed so that users can "check" off the items they have collected for their kits.

## Monetization

With the design of our app and intended use, we feel that ads are not the way to go and this app will be either paid or as a non-profit with support from other organization. The app is intended to reach as many people as possible and being as accessible as possible.

## Measuring engagement

The engagement of our users would typically be a user that access our app 2-5 times a month. With our app being focused on natural disasters, people aren't going to be on it at all times. They might check in at our alerts from time to time, or add something to their survival kit. But most people won't be accessing it until there is an imminent threat of disaster which can happen at anytime.

## Stretch features

Some future considerations we may have is some kind of emergency response integration that will notify emergency services that you are in distress. A feature that allows our My kit items to be checked off as well.
